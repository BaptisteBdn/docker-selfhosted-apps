Wireguard is a virtual private network (VPN), it provides you a secure, encrypted tunnel for online traffic and allow you to manage a remote private network.
Pihole is a DNS sinkhole that protects your devices from unwanted content without installing any client-side software. Unbound is a validating, recursive, caching DNS resolver.

This guide combine the three services so that every device that are connected to the VPN also pass through pihole and unbound. Having a VPN will also reinforce security for your overall infrastructure as you can combine it with [traefik IP whitelist](../traefik#Configuration).

  ```

# Usage

## Requirements

* A subdomain of your choice for your VPN, this example uses `vpn`.
  * You should be able to create a subdomain with your DNS provider, use a `A record` with the same IP address as your root domain.
* Ports 51820 open, check your firewall.

## Configuration

The linuxserver images are using the PUID and PGID, they allow the container to map the container's internal user to a user on the host machine, more information [here](https://docs.linuxserver.io/general/understanding-puid-and-pgid).

To find yours, use `id user`. Replace the environment variables in `.env` with your own, then run :

```bash
sudo docker-compose up -d
```

### Wireguard

* Getting the client configuration file

You should be able to find the required configuration for your clients in the `wireguard` directory. Each client will have an associated folder called `peerX`.
Inside this folder you can find a QR code for your smartphone as well as configuration file for your linux/windows.

* Adding more clients

If you want more clients, just change the value in the `.env` file and relaunch the service `sudo docker-compose up -d`.


### Pihole

Once connected to the VPN you should be able to access the pihole admin interface at http://10.2.0.100/admin, for more information regarding pihole you can check the well written official pihole [documentation](https://docs.pi-hole.net/).

# Update

The images are automatically updated with [watchtower](../watchtower) thanks to the following label :

```yaml
  # Watchtower Update
  - "com.centurylinklabs.watchtower.enable=true"
```

# Security

A VPN is often a good solution to always have a dedicated IP. If you want to secure your others services, you can limit their access only when you are connected to your VPN. An easy way to do that is to add the VPN IP to the traefik [whitelist](traefik/rules/whitelist.yml).

Keep in mind that only the containers that have the following label attached will be prone to this IP restriction.

```yaml
  # Ip filtering
  - "traefik.http.routers.bitwarden.middlewares=whitelist@file"
```

# Backup

Docker volumes are globally backed up using [borg-backup](../borg-backup).
