Watchtower is a container-based solution for automating Docker container base image updates. It will pull down your new image, gracefully shut down your existing container and restart it with the same options that were used when it was deployed initially.


# Table of Contents

# File structure 

```
.
|-- .env
`-- docker-compose.yml
```

- `.env` - a file containing all the environment variables used in the docker-compose.yml
- `docker-compose.yml` - a docker-compose file, use to configure your applicationâ€™s services

Please make sure that all the files and directories are present.

# Information

The following docker-compose is configured to check for update every monday. If you are using the borg-backup [strategy](../borg-backup), everything will be backed-up before the image is updated to prevent data corruption. 

Watchtower if configured to automatically upgrade your images and to then, send you a notification with [gotify](../gotify). Everything can be changed by modifying the [environnement variables](https://containrrr.dev/watchtower/arguments/).

## docker-compose
Links to the following [docker-compose.yml](docker-compose.yml) and the corresponding [.env](.env).

```
version: "3"

services:
  watchtower:
    image: containrrr/watchtower
    container_name: watchtower
    restart: unless-stopped
    volumes:
      - /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock
    environment:
      - WATCHTOWER_CLEANUP=true
      - WATCHTOWER_LABEL_ENABLE=true
      #- WATCHTOWER_POLL_INTERVAL=30
      - WATCHTOWER_SCHEDULE=0 0 4 * * MON
      - WATCHTOWER_NOTIFICATIONS=gotify
      - WATCHTOWER_NOTIFICATION_GOTIFY_URL=${GOTIFY_URL}
      - WATCHTOWER_NOTIFICATION_GOTIFY_TOKEN=${GOTIFY_TOKEN}
    labels:
      - "com.centurylinklabs.watchtower.enable=true"
```

# Usage

## Configuration

Replace the environment variables in `.env` with your own, then run :

```
sudo docker-compose up -d
```

Watchtower will then check for update every monday and send you a notification with gotify one an image is updated.

# Update

The image is automatically updated with [watchtower](../watchtower) thanks to the following label :

```
      # Watchtower Update
      - "com.centurylinklabs.watchtower.enable=true"
```

# Security

Automatically upgrading open-source images can be a huge security risk. The safest solution would be to only [monitor](https://containrrr.dev/watchtower/arguments/#without_updating_containers) the images and check the updated image before doing the upgrade.

# Backup

Backup are not required.
