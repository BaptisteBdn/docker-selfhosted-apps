Fail2ban scans log files and bans IPs that show the malicious signs.

* [Github](https://github.com/fail2ban/fail2ban)
* [Documentation](http://www.fail2ban.org/wiki/index.php/Fail2Ban)
* [Docker Image](https://github.com/crazy-max/docker-fail2ban)

We are going to be using a prebuilt docker image by crazymax to facilitate the process.
There are a lot of fail2ban configurations availabe on the internet, and you can even create your own, this guide provides the following features :

- SSH jail configuration
- Vaultwarden jail configuration

- `data/action.d` - a directory containing custom action configuration to execute when banning an IP
- `data/db` - a directory used to store fail2ban sqlite database
- `data/filter.d` - a directory containing custom filter configuration used by a jail to match malicious signs
- `data/jail.d` - a directory containing custom jail configuration for your services
- `docker-compose.yml` - a docker-compose file, use to configure your applicationâ€™s services

Please make sure that all the files and directories are present.


# Information

## docker-compose
Links to the following [docker-compose.yml](docker-compose.yml).

```yaml
version: '3'

services:
  fail2ban:
    image: crazymax/fail2ban:latest
    container_name: fail2ban
    restart: unless-stopped
    volumes:
      - /var/log:/var/log:ro
      - ./data:/data
    environment:
      - TZ={$TZ}
    network_mode: "host"
    cap_add:
    - NET_ADMIN
    - NET_RAW
    labels:
      # Watchtower Update
      - "com.centurylinklabs.watchtower.enable=true"
```

We are gonna use `/var/log` directory to parse log files.

## jails

The jail.d directory is provided with three examples.

- sshd.conf : provides ssh protection, will ban any IP trying to bruteforce your ssh credentials, a must-have if you are still on port 22.

- vaultwarden.conf : provides your vaultwarden password manager from bruteforce. 

- vaultwarden-admin : provides your vaultwarden admin dashboard from bruteforce. 

You can find the vaultwarden filters in the filter.d directory. For example, in `filter.d/vaultwarden-auth` you can find :

```
[INCLUDES]
before = common.conf

[Definition]
failregex = ^.*Username or password is incorrect\. Try again\. IP: <HOST>\. Username:.*$
ignoreregex =
```

This filter is using regex and will match any log that fails to connect to your vaultwarden vault. The log file that is parsed is `/var/log/syslog`, redirection is provided with the docker-compose available in the [vaultwarden guide](../vaultwarden).

# Usage

## Configuration

Replace the environment variables in `.env` with your own, then run :

```bash
sudo docker-compose up -d
```

The jails and filters configured are going to be active, you can now create as many as you want to protect your services.

# Update

The image is automatically updated with [watchtower](../watchtower) thanks to the following label :

```yaml
      # Watchtower Update
      - "com.centurylinklabs.watchtower.enable=true"
```

# Security

Be careful not to get ban as the iptable action is pretty aggressive, you will not be able to SSH with the banned IP.

# Backup

Docker volumes are globally backed up using [borg-backup](../borg-backup).
